```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require("tidyverse")
```
## Exercise 

1. It creates an empty graph
``` {r}
ggplot(data=mpg)
````

2. There are 32 rows and 11 columns.

```{r}
dim(mtcars)
```

3. drv is a categorical variable that takes there values f , r and 4 signfying whether the car is a front-wheel , rear-wheel or four wheel drive.


4. Scatterplot of hwy vs cyl

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=hwy,y=cyl))
```

4. Plot of class vs drv

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=class,y=drv))
```

This is not useful because class and drv are both categorical variables.
